# Election Template

This is a website template that I made for my school's upcoming elections. It doesn't yet have a voting feature, but it's to show the candidates to anyone interested in the election and to put all info on display.

## Pages

### Candidates

    This contains a list of candidates and their affiliates, as well as blurbs about their stances and how they wish to benefit the school. Additionally, links to the candidates' social medias are displayed.

### Updates

    This contains updates (from the news team) about the election, including new candidates, announcements about the election, and campaign events.

### Code of Conduct

    This is a page displaying the website's Code of Conduct, or the policies that the News Team abides by, so as to assure readers that we operate free of bias.
